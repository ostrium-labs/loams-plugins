/**
 * Flint `DesignDecisions` -> the ink a React Flow graph is painted with.
 *
 * The seam is the *grounded* theme, not the authored one, for the reason
 * `plugin-echarts-render/src/theme-decisions.ts` states at length: `ThemeSpec` is
 * level 1 and binds no colour to any role, while `groundTheme` produces level 2,
 * with flint's ink borrowing chain, presence ordinals and accessibility rules
 * already applied. Reading a spec here would mean re-implementing all of that
 * and getting it subtly wrong. So this consumes decisions and never a spec.
 *
 * A graph is not a chart, so the mapping is smaller and there is no series to
 * recolour. What it needs is a surface, two inks of text, one rule ink for the
 * node borders and the edges, and -- the one thing that is genuinely a chart
 * decision carried over -- the categorical palette, which paints the nodes
 * exactly as it would paint the series of a bar chart of the same count.
 *
 * Every read is defensive and every field falls back independently, because a
 * theme that partially resolves is a real state: flint grounds what it can and
 * reports the rest. One absent role must not blank the whole tile.
