 * Local change: the `~/lib/utils` import of `cn` now points at this
 * repo's own reimplementation in `../cn.ts`, which is the same two lines
 * minus t3code's contracts/effect imports.
 *
 * Second local change: this copy lives in `@loams-plugins/core` rather than in the host
 * app. The plugin console that uses `Switch` is part of the shell, and the
 * shell cannot import from the app that renders it -- `dashboard-ui` depends on
 * `@loams-plugins/core`, so the dependency only points one way. Everything here is
 * re-exported from `@loams-plugins/core/ui`; the host app imports it from there.
