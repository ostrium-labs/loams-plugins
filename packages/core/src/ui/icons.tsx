/*
 * The shell's icon set.
 *
 * lucide-react is the single source of icon artwork across the app -- these
 * are thin wrappers that pin the same pixel sizes `dashboard-ui`'s
 * `components/Icons.tsx` uses, so the console reads at the same weight as the
 * dashboard header. `ShellMarkIcon` is the one exception and stays hand-drawn:
 * it is the product mark, not a pictogram, and has no lucide equivalent.
 *
 * This module lives in `packages/core` rather than importing from
 * `dashboard-ui` because core is the lower layer: dashboard-ui imports
 * `@loams-plugins/core/ui`, so the dependency cannot also point back.
