 * The ported t3code primitives.
 *
 * These files are copied verbatim from t3code 0.0.45 (MIT, T3 Tools Inc 2026)
 * with two changes: `cn` comes from this repo's own `../cn.ts` instead of
 * t3code's `~/lib/utils` (which pulled in `@t3tools/contracts` and `effect`),
 * and they live in `packages/core/src/ui/primitives` rather than here, because
 * the plugin console in `@loams-plugins/core` renders one of them and the dependency only
 * points one way. `@loams-plugins/core/ui` re-exports all nine.
 *
 * What is worth testing here is the thing a copy can silently lose: the token
 * names in their class strings (`--control-radius`, `--ring`, `--background`, and
 * the `text-2xs`..`text-5xs` sizes registered only through `cn`). If a token
 * stops being declared in `styles.css` the component renders unstyled and
 * nothing throws -- so these tests assert the tokens are actually reachable
 * from the stylesheet.
