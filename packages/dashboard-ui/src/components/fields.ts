 * Shared form vocabulary for the dashboard's panels.
 *
 * The Inspector, the chart picker, the theme customizer and the per-widget theme
 * field all ask for the same four things: a stacked group, a label, a control,
 * and a line of help text. They used to be `.form-group`, `.form-label`,
 * `.form-input`/`.form-select`/`.sheet-input`/`.sheet-select` and
 * `.sheet-help-text` -- five names for one shape, which is how `.form-label`
 * ended up referenced with no rule at all.
 *
 * Colours come from the `@theme inline` ink tokens, so a Flint theme repaints
 * every panel from the same write that repaints the charts.
