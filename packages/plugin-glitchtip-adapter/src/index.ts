/**
 * GlitchTip adapter — public surface.
 *
 * The manifest is exported here rather than registered anywhere. Catalog
 * registration belongs to the integration step that composes the plugin host.
 *
 * PROVENANCE: the research for this adapter ran against the Angular 22.1 SPA,
 * whose `src/app/api/api-schema.d.ts` is generated from the server's own
 * `/api/openapi.json` — so paths and shapes are server truth. Against a live
 * instance, `GET /api/openapi.json` is the version-drift check.
